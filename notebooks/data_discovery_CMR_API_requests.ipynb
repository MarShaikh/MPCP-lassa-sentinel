    "# Data Discovery with NASA's CMR Using `requests` Python Library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through how to search for Earthdata data collections and granules. Along the way we will explore the available search parameters, information return, and specific contrains when using the CMR API. Our object is to identify assets to access that we would downloaded, or perform S3 direct access, within an analysis workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what CMR/CMR API is and what CMR/CMR API can be used for \n",
    "- How to use the `requests` library to search data collections and granules\n",
    "- How to parse the results of these searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CMR\n",
    "CMR is the Common Metadata Repository.  It catalogs all data for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).  It is the backend of [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), the GUI search interface.  More information about CMR can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the GUI for Earthdata Search is not accessible from a cloud instance - at least not without some work.  Earthdata Search is also not immediately reproducible.  What I mean by that is if you create a search using the GUI you would have to note the search criteria (date range, search area, collection name, etc), take a screenshot, copy the search url, or save the list of data granules returned by the search, in order to recreate the search.  This information would have to be re-entered each time you or someone else wanted to do the search.  You could make typos or other mistakes.  A cleaner, reproducible solution is to search CMR programmatically using the CMR API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the CMR API\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface.  It allows applications (software, services, etc) to send information to each other.  A helpful analogy is a waiter in a restaurant.  The waiter takes your drink or food order that you select from the menu, often translated into short-hand, to the bar or kitchen, and then returns (hopefully) with what you ordered when it is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMR API accepts search terms such as collection name, keywords, datetime range, and location, queries the CMR database and returns the results."

See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSS30 product.\\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues\\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically high aerosol and low surface reflectance over bright areas: The atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low. High aerosol retrievals, both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol, are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 (see Table 9 in the [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1698/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf)); the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysis.\\\\n\\\\n* Issues over high latitudes: For scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north, multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times. In this same area, it is also possible that Landsat overpasses that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate data files. Finally, for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees north, ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenes.\\\\n\\\\n* Fmask omission errors: There are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022. The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult, and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief. This issue does not impact other bands in the dataset.\\\\n\\\\n* Inconsistent snow surface reflectance between Landsat and Sentinel-2: The HLS snow surface reflectance can be highly inconsistent between Landsat and Sentinel-2. When assessed on same-day acquisitions from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Landsat reflectance is generally higher than Sentinel-2 reflectance in the visible bands.\\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically high snow surface reflectance in the visible bands: By design, the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over snow; instead, a default aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is used to drive the snow surface reflectance. If the snow detection fails, the full LaSRC is used in both AOT retrieval and surface reflectance derivation over snow, which produces surface reflectance values as high as 1.6 in the visible bands. This is a common problem for spring images at high latitudes.\\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically low surface reflectance surrounding snow/ice: Related to the above, the AOT retrieval over snow/ice is generally too high. When this artificially high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring non-snow pixels, very low surface reflectance will result. These pixels will appear very dark in the visible bands. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. In Figure 1, the pixels in front of the glaciers have surface reflectance values that are too low.  \\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically low reflectance surrounding clouds: Like for snow, the HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over clouds and a default AOT is used instead. But if the cloud detection fails, an artificially high AOT will be retrieved over clouds. If the high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring cloud-free pixels, very low surface reflectance values will result. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. \\\\n\\\\n* Unusually low reflectance around other bright land targets: While the HLS atmospheric correction retrieves AOT over non-cloud, non-snow bright pixels, the retrieved AOT over bright targets can be unrealistically high in some cases, similar to cloud or snow. If this unrealistically high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring pixels, very low surface reflectance values can result as shown in Figure 2. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. These types of bright targets are mostly man-made, such as buildings, parking lots, and roads.  \\\\n\\\\n* Dark plumes over water: The HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over water. For water pixels, the AOT retrieved from the nearest land pixels is used to derive the surface reflectance, but if the retrieval is incorrect, e.g. from a cloud pixel, this high AOT will create dark stripes over water, as shown in Figure 3. This happens more often over large water bodies, such as lakes and bays, than over narrow rivers.  \\\\n\\\\n* Landsat WRS-2 Path/Row boundary in L30 reflectance: HLS performs atmospheric correction on Landsat Level 1 images in the original Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS2) path/row before the derived surface reflectance is reprojected into Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles. If a WRS-2 Landsat image is very cloudy, the AOT from a few remaining clear pixels might be used for the atmospheric correction of the entire image. The AOT that is used can be quite different from the value for the adjacent row in the same path, which results in an artificial abrupt change from one row to the next, as shown in Figure 4. This occurrence is very rare.  \\\\n \\\\n* Landsat WRS2 path/row boundary in cloud masks: The cloud mask algorithm Fmask creates mask labels by applying thresholds to the histograms of some metrics for each path/row independently. If two adjacent rows in the same path have distinct distributions within the metrics, abrupt changes in masking patterns can appear across the row boundary, as shown in Figure 5. This occurrence is very rare.  \\\\n\\\\n* Fmask configuration was deficient for 2-3 months in 2021: The HLS installation of Fmask failed to include auxiliary digital elevation model (DEM) and European Space Agency (ESA) Global Surface Water Occurrence data for a 2-3 month run in 2021. This impacted the masking results over water and in mountainous regions. \\\\n\\\\n* The reflectance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscale_factor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9coffset\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for some L30 and S30 bands were not set: The HLS reflectance scaling factor is 0.0001 and offset is 0. However, this information was not set in the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files of some bands for a small number of granules. The lack of this information creates a problem for automatic conversion of the reflectance data, requiring explicit scaling in applications. The problem has been corrected, but the affected granules have not been reprocessed. \\\\n\\\\n* Incomplete map projection information: For a time, HLS imagery was produced with an incomplete coordinate reference system (CRS). The metadata contains the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone and coordinates necessary to geolocate pixels within the image but might not be in a standard form, especially for granules produced early in the HLS mission. As a result, an error will occur in certain image processing packages due to the incomplete CRS. The simplest solution is to update to the latest version of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and/or rasterio, which use the available information without error. \\\\n\\\\n* False northing of 10^7 for the L30 angle data: The L30 and S30 products do not use a false northing for the UTM projection, and the angle data are supposed to follow the same convention. However, the L30 angle data incorrectly uses a false northing of 10^7. There is no problem with the angle data itself, but the false northing needs to be set to 0 for it to be aligned with the reflectance.\\\\n\\\\n* L30 from Landsat L1GT scenes: Landsat L1GT scenes were not intended for HLS due to their poor geolocation. However, some scenes made it through screening for a short period of HLS production. L1GT L30 scenes mainly consist of extensive cloud or snow that can be eliminated using the Fmask quality bits layer. Users can also identify an L1GT-originated L30 granule by examining the HLS cmr.xml metadata file.\\\\n\\\\n* The UTC dates in the L30/S30 filenames may not be the local dates: UTC dates are used by ESA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in naming their Level 1 images, and HLS processing retains this information to name the L30 and S30 products. Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass eastern Australia and New Zealand around 10AM local solar time, but this area is in either UTC+10:00 or +11:00 zone; therefore, the UTC time for some orbits is in fact near the end of the preceding UTC day. For example, HLS.S30.T59HQS.2016117T221552.v2.0 was acquired in the 22nd hour of day 117 of year 2016 in UTC, but the time was 10:15:52 of day 118 locally. Approximately 100 minutes later HLS.S30.T56JML.2016117T235252.v2.0 was acquired in the next orbit in eastern Australia.  \\\\n\\\\n     This issue also occurs for Landsat. For example, HLS.L30.T59HQS.2016117T221209.v2.0 was acquired on the same day as the first S30 example given above, but both on day 118 of 2016 locally. Adding to the confusion for L30, in the same region, Landsat 8 and 9 can each overpass once in one of the two adjacent WRS-2 Paths (91/92/93) over a two-day period on a local calendar, but based on UTC time, the two overpasses can appear to be on the same day. For example, in the following seemingly same-day pair, the second L30 is actually for day 168 locally:  \\\\n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T000407.v2.0  \\\\n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T235747.v2.0  \\\\n     Bear in mind, the date peculiarity for the data occurs when the overpass time is during the late hours of a UTC day.  \\\\n\\\\n* The atmospheric ancillary data from the wrong date was used for LaSRC: Related to the above, for eastern Australia and New Zealand, L30 and S30 surface reflectance on certain days was created using the atmospheric ancillary data from a date that was one day too early. The exact geographic extent of the affected HLS products and the impact on the surface reflectance quality are under investigation. Practice caution when using data with overpass times during the late hours of a UTC day.\\\\n\\\\n* Duplicates in L30: The Landsat 9 acquisitions from October 2021 to March 2023 in Landsat Collection 2 were reprocessed by USGS in March 2023. This reprocessing updated the overpass time by a fraction of a second for some scenes. Since HLS uses overpass time as part of the L30 filename, the older L30 granules were not automatically overwritten due to the different filenames. For example, the first L30 granule in the following pair originated from an older version of L1TP of Landsat 9 with the second granule originating from the reprocessed version.  \\\\nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182646.v2.0  \\\\nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182645.v2.0  \\\\nThere are other causes of duplicate L30 granules, but the overall number of duplicates is very small.\\\\n\\\\n* Poor Geolocation: A large amount of granules that were processed for May through July 2023 were created with L1GT input scenes which were deemed undesirable due to a poor geolocation issue. These granules were removed from the archive. (see the full list of removed [granules](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2161/L30_L1GT_granules_May_July_2023.csv))\\\\n\\\\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\\\\n\\\\n* Aerosol QA bits from the USGS Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) model output have been added into the Function of Mask (Fmask) data layer.

Mission (SRTM) datasets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. The purpose of SRTM was to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was a primary component of the payload on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission. Endeavour launched February 11, 2000 and flew for 11 days.\\\\n\\\\nSRTM collected data in swaths, which extend from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km). These swaths are ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60\\xc2\\xb0 N and 56\\xc2\\xb0 S latitude.

The primary goal of creating the Version 3 data was to eliminate voids that were present in earlier versions of SRTM data.

High aerosol retrievals, both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol, are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 (see Table 9 in the [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1698/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf)); the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysis.\\\\n\\\\n* Issues over high latitudes: For scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north, multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times. In this same area, it is also possible that Landsat overpasses that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate data files. Finally, for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees north, ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenes.\\\\n\\\\n* Fmask omission errors: There are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022. The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult, and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief. This issue does not impact other bands in the dataset.\\\\n\\\\n* Inconsistent snow surface reflectance between Landsat and Sentinel-2: The HLS snow surface reflectance can be highly inconsistent between Landsat and Sentinel-2. When assessed on same-day acquisitions from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Landsat reflectance is generally higher than Sentinel-2 reflectance in the visible bands.\\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically high snow surface reflectance in the visible bands: By design, the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over snow; instead, a default aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is used to drive the snow surface reflectance. If the snow detection fails, the full LaSRC is used in both AOT retrieval and surface reflectance derivation over snow, which produces surface reflectance values as high as 1.6 in the visible bands. This is a common problem for spring images at high latitudes.\\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically low surface reflectance surrounding snow/ice: Related to the above, the AOT retrieval over snow/ice is generally too high. When this artificially high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring non-snow pixels, very low surface reflectance will result. These pixels will appear very dark in the visible bands. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used.\\\\n\\\\n* Unrealistically low reflectance surrounding clouds: Like for snow, the HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over clouds and a default AOT is used instead. But if the cloud detection fails, an artificially high AOT will be retrieved over clouds. If the high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring cloud-free pixels, very low surface reflectance values will result. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. \\\\n\\\\n* Unusually low reflectance around other bright land targets: While the HLS atmospheric correction retrieves AOT over non-cloud, non-snow bright pixels, the retrieved AOT over bright targets can be unrealistically high in some cases, similar to cloud or snow. If this unrealistically high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring pixels, very low surface reflectance values can result as shown in Figure 2. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. These types of bright targets are mostly man-made, such as buildings, parking lots, and roads.  \\\\n\\\\n* Dark plumes over water: The HLS atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over water. For water pixels, the AOT retrieved from the nearest land pixels is used to derive the surface reflectance, but if the retrieval is incorrect, e.g. from a cloud pixel, this high AOT will create dark stripes over water, as shown in Figure 3. This happens more often over large water bodies, such as lakes and bays, than over narrow rivers.  \\\\n\\\\n* Landsat WRS-2 Path/Row boundary in L30 reflectance: HLS performs atmospheric correction on Landsat Level 1 images in the original Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS2) path/row before the derived surface reflectance is reprojected into Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles. If a WRS-2 Landsat image is very cloudy, the AOT from a few remaining clear pixels might be used for the atmospheric correction of the entire image. The AOT that is used can be quite different from the value for the adjacent row in the same path, which results in an artificial abrupt change from one row to the next, as shown in Figure 4. This occurrence is very rare.  \\\\n \\\\n* Landsat WRS2 path/row boundary in cloud masks: The cloud mask algorithm Fmask creates mask labels by applying thresholds to the histograms of some metrics for each path/row independently. If two adjacent rows in the same path have distinct distributions within the metrics, abrupt changes in masking patterns can appear across the row boundary, as shown in Figure 5. This occurrence is very rare.  \\\\n\\\\n* Fmask configuration was deficient for 2-3 months in 2021: The HLS installation of Fmask failed to include auxiliary digital elevation model (DEM) and European Space Agency (ESA) Global Surface Water Occurrence data for a 2-3 month run in 2021. This impacted the masking results over water and in mountainous regions. \\\\n\\\\n* The reflectance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscale_factor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9coffset\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for some L30 and S30 bands were not set: The HLS reflectance scaling factor is 0.0001 and offset is 0. However, this information was not set in the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files of some bands for a small number of granules. The lack of this information creates a problem for automatic conversion of the reflectance data, requiring explicit scaling in applications. The problem has been corrected, but the affected granules have not been reprocessed. \\\\n\\\\n* Incomplete map projection information: For a time, HLS imagery was produced with an incomplete coordinate reference system (CRS). The metadata contains the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone and coordinates necessary to geolocate pixels within the image but might not be in a standard form, especially for granules produced early in the HLS mission. As a result, an error will occur in certain image processing packages due to the incomplete CRS. The simplest solution is to update to the latest version of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and/or rasterio, which use the available information without error. \\\\n\\\\n* False northing of 10^7 for the L30 angle data: The L30 and S30 products do not use a false northing for the UTM projection, and the angle data are supposed to follow the same convention. However, the L30 angle data incorrectly uses a false northing of 10^7. There is no problem with the angle data itself, but the false northing needs to be set to 0 for it to be aligned with the reflectance.\\\\n\\\\n* L30 from Landsat L1GT scenes: Landsat L1GT scenes were not intended for HLS due to their poor geolocation. However, some scenes made it through screening for a short period of HLS production. L1GT L30 scenes mainly consist of extensive cloud or snow that can be eliminated using the Fmask quality bits layer. Users can also identify an L1GT-originated L30 granule by examining the HLS cmr.xml metadata file.\\\\n\\\\n* The UTC dates in the L30/S30 filenames may not be the local dates: UTC dates are used by ESA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in naming their Level 1 images, and HLS processing retains this information to name the L30 and S30 products. Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass eastern Australia and New Zealand around 10AM local solar time, but this area is in either UTC+10:00 or +11:00 zone; therefore, the UTC time for some orbits is in fact near the end of the preceding UTC day. For example, HLS.S30.T59HQS.2016117T221552.v2.0 was acquired in the 22nd hour of day 117 of year 2016 in UTC, but the time was 10:15:52 of day 118 locally. Approximately 100 minutes later HLS.S30.T56JML.2016117T235252.v2.0 was acquired in the next orbit in eastern Australia. \\\\n\\\\n     This issue also occurs for Landsat. For example, HLS.L30.T59HQS.2016117T221209.v2.0 was acquired on the same day as the first S30 example given above, but both on day 118 of 2016 locally. Adding to the confusion for L30, in the same region, Landsat 8 and 9 can each overpass once in one of the two adjacent WRS-2 Paths (91/92/93) over a two-day period on a local calendar, but based on UTC time, the two overpasses can appear to be on the same day. For example, in the following seemingly same-day pair, the second L30 is actually for day 168 locally:  \\\\n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T000407.v2.0  \\\\n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T235747.v2.0  \\\\n     Bear in mind, the date peculiarity for the data occurs when the overpass time is during the late hours of a UTC day. \\\\n\\\\n* The atmospheric ancillary data from the wrong date was used for LaSRC: Related to the above, for eastern Australia and New Zealand, L30 and S30 surface reflectance on certain days was created using the atmospheric ancillary data from a date that was one day too early. The exact geographic extent of the affected HLS products and the impact on the surface reflectance quality are under investigation. Practice caution when using data with overpass times during the late hours of a UTC day.\\\\n\\\\n* Duplicates in L30: The Landsat 9 acquisitions from October 2021 to March 2023 in Landsat Collection 2 were reprocessed by USGS in March 2023. This reprocessing updated the overpass time by a fraction of a second for some scenes. Since HLS uses overpass time as part of the L30 filename, the older L30 granules were not automatically overwritten due to the different filenames. For example, the first L30 granule in the following pair originated from an older version of L1TP of Landsat 9 with the second granule originating from the reprocessed version.    \\\\nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182646.v2.0  \\\\nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182645.v2.0  \\\\nThere are other causes of duplicate L30 granules, but the overall number of duplicates is very small.\\\\n\\\\n* Poor Geolocation: A large amount of granules that were processed for May through July 2023 were created with L1GT input scenes which were deemed undesirable due to a poor geolocation issue. These granules were removed from the archive. (see the full list of removed [granules](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2161/L30_L1GT_granules_May_July_2023.csv))\\\\n\\\\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\\\\n\\\\n* Aerosol QA bits from the USGS Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) model output have been added into the Function of Mask (Fmask) data layer. The added two bits indicate the aerosol levels: high, medium, low, and climatology

Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 3 (ASTGTM) provides a global digital elevation model (DEM) of land areas on Earth at a spatial resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30 meter horizontal posting at the equator).\\\\n\\\\nThe development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan\\'s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. \\\\n\\\\nThe ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire [ASTER Level 1A](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database ([ASTWBD](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001)) Version 1 data product was also generated. \\\\n\\\\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83\\xc2\\xb0 North to 83\\xc2\\xb0 South. Each tile is distributed in both a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) and NetCDF4 format through NASA Earthdata Search and in standard GeoTIFF format through the LP DAAC Data Pool. Data are projected on the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each of the 22,912 tiles in the collection contain at least 0.01% land area. \\\\n\\\\nProvided in the ASTER GDEM product are layers for DEM and number of scenes (NUM). The NUM layer indicates the number of scenes that were processed for each pixel and the source of the data.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the ASTER GDEM Version 3 data products offer substantial improvements over Version 2, users are advised that the products still may contain anomalies and artifacts that will reduce its usability for certain applications. \\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues\\\\n* ASTER GDEM Version 3 tiles overlap by one pixel to the north, south, east, and west of the tile perimeter. In most cases the overlapping edge pixels have identical pixel values, but it is possible that in some instances values will differ. \\\\n* ASTER GDEM Version 3 is considered to be void free except for Greenland and Antarctica.\\\\n* Users are reminded that because there are known inaccuracies and artifacts in the dataset, to use the product with awareness of these limitations.

Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) Version 6.1 data are generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MOD13Q1 product provides two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.\\\\n\\\\nAlong with the vegetation layers and the two quality layers, the HDF file will have MODIS reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as four observation layers. \\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues\\\\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\\\\n\\\\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\\\\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\\\\n* A

Investigation ([GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/)) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carbon cycle and biodiversity. The GEDI instrument produces high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3-dimensional structure of the Earth. GEDI is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 51.6\\xc2\\xb0 N and 51.6\\xc2\\xb0 S latitudes at the highest resolution and densest sampling of any light detection and ranging (lidar) instrument in orbit to date. Each GEDI Version 2 granule encompasses one-fourth of an ISS orbit and includes georeferenced metadata to allow for spatial querying and subsetting.\\\\n\\\\nThe GEDI instrument was removed from the ISS and placed into storage on March 17, 2023. No data were acquired during the hibernation period from March 17, 2023, to April 24, 2024. GEDI has since been reinstalled on the ISS and resumed operations as of April 26, 2024.\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose of the GEDI Level 2A Geolocated Elevation and Height Metrics product (GEDI02_A) is to provide waveform interpretation and extracted products from each GEDI01_B received waveform, including ground elevation, canopy top height, and relative height (RH) metrics. The methodology for generating the GEDI02_A product datasets is adapted from the Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) algorithm. The GEDI02_A product is provided in HDF5 format and has a spatial resolution (average footprint) of 25 meters.\\\\n\\\\nThe GEDI02_A data product contains 156 layers for each of the eight beams, including ground elevation, canopy top height, relative return energy metrics (e.g., canopy vertical structure), and many other interpreted products from the return waveforms. Additional information for the layers can be found in the GEDI Level 2A Dictionary.\\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues\\\\n\\\\n* Data acquisition gaps: GEDI data acquisitions were suspended on December 19, 2019 (2019 Day 353) and resumed on January 8, 2020 (2020 Day 8).\\\\n* Incorrect Reference Ground Track (RGT) number in the filename for select GEDI files: GEDI Science Data Products for six orbits on August 7, 2020, and November 12, 2021, had the incorrect RGT number in the filename. There is no impact to the science data, but users should reference this [document](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2236/GEDI_CORRECTED_RGT_FILENAMES.pptx) for the correct RGT numbers.\\\\n* Known Issues: Section 8 of the User Guide provides additional information on known issues.\\\\n\\\\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\\\\n\\\\n* Metadata has been updated to include spatial coordinates.\\\\n* Granule size has been reduced from one full ISS orbit (~5.83 GB) to four segments per orbit (~1.48 GB).\\\\n* Filename has been updated to include segment number and version number.\\\\n* Improved geolocation for an orbital segment.\\\\n* Added elevation from the SRTM digital elevation model for comparison.\\\\n* Modified the method to predict an optimum algorithm setting group per laser shot.\\\\n* Added additional land cover datasets related to phenology, urban infrastructure, and water persistence.\\\\n* Added selected_mode_flag dataset to root beam group using

Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies and Fire (MYD14) Version 6.1 product is produced daily in 5-minute temporal satellite increments (swaths). The MYD14 product is used to generate all of the higher level fire products, but can also be used to identify fires and other thermal anomalies, such as volcanoes. Each swath of data is approximately 2,030 kilometers along track (long), and 2,300 kilometers across track (wide). \\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues\\\\n* For complete information about known issues please refer

Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012

Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arid dust source regions. EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and uses imaging spectroscopy to take mineralogical measurements of sunlit regions of interest between 52\\xc2\\xb0 N latitude and 52\\xc2\\xb0 S latitude. An interactive map showing the regions being investigated, current and forecasted data coverage, and additional data resources can be found on the VSWIR Imaging Spectroscopy Interface for Open Science (VISIONS) [EMIT Open Data Portal](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/data/data-portal/coverage-and-forecasts/).\\\\n\\\\nThe EMIT Level 2A Estimated Surface Reflectance and Uncertainty and Masks (EMITL2ARFL) Version 1 data product provides surface reflectance data in a spatially raw, non-orthocorrected format. Each EMITL2ARFL granule consists of three Network Common Data Format 4 (NetCDF4) files at a spatial resolution of 60 meters (m): Reflectance (EMIT_L2A_RFL), Reflectance Uncertainty (EMIT_L2A_RFLUNCERT), and Reflectance Mask (EMIT_L2A_MASK). The Reflectance file contains surface reflectance maps of 285 bands with a spectral range of 381-2493 nanometers (nm) at a spectral resolution of ~7.5 nm, which are held within a single science dataset layer (SDS). The Reflectance Uncertainty file contains uncertainty estimates about the reflectance captured as per-pixel, per-band, posterior standard deviations. The Reflectance Mask file contains six binary flag bands and two data bands. The binary flag bands identify the presence of features including clouds, water, and spacecraft which indicate if a pixel should be excluded from analysis. The data bands contain estimates of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and water vapor.\\\\n\\\\nEach NetCDF4 file holds a location group containing a geometric lookup table (GLT) which is an orthorectified image that provides relative x and y reference locations from the raw scene to allow for projection of the data. Along with the GLT layers, the files will also contain latitude, longitude, and elevation layers. The latitude and longitude coordinates are presented using the World Geodetic System (WGS84) ellipsoid. The elevation data was obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission v3 (SRTM v3) data and resampled to EMIT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spatial resolution.\\\\n\\\\nEach granule is approximately 75 kilometers (km) by 75 km, nominal at the equator, with some granules at the end of an orbit segment reaching 150 km in length.\\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues:\\\\n\\\\n* Data acquisition gap: From September 13, 2022, through January 6, 2023, a power issue outside of EMIT caused a pause in operations. Due to this shutdown, no data were acquired during that timeframe.\\\\n* Possible Reflectance Discrepancies: Due to changes in computational architecture, EMITL2ARFL reflectance data produced after December 4, 2024, with Software Build 010621 and onward may show discrepancies in reflectance of up to 0.8% in extreme cases in some wavelengths as compared to values in previously processed data. These discrepancies are generally lower than 0.8% and well within estimated uncertainties. Between earlier builds and Build 010621, neither resulting output should be interpreted as more \\xe2\\x80\\x98correct\\xe2\\x80\\x99 than the other, as their results are simply convergence differences from an optimization search.

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\\xc2\\xb0 N and 52\\xc2\\xb0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found in Figure 2 on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\\\\n\\\\nThe ECOSTRESS Tiled Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous Level 2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2T_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2T_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. This tiled data product is subset from the [ECO_L2G_LSTE](https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L2G_LSTE.002) data product using a modified version of the Military Grid Reference System ([MGRS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/)) which divides Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zones into square tiles that are 109.8 km by 109.8 km with a 70 meter (m) spatial resolution.\\\\n\\\\nThe ECO_L2T_LSTE Version 2 data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate COG. This product contains seven layers including LST, LST error, wideband emissivity, quality flags, height, and cloud and water masks.\\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues\\\\n* Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\\\\n* Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\\\\n* Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\\\\n* Data alert: All users of ECOSTRESS L2 v002 products (ECO_L2T_LSTE, ECO_L2_LSTE, ECO_L2G_LSTE) should be aware that the cloud mask information previously available in the Quality Control (QC) layer in v001, is not available in the v002 QC layer. Instead, users should be using the \\'cloud_mask\\' layer in the L2 LSTE product, or the cloud information in the standard cloud mask products (ECO_L2_CLOUD, ECO_L2T_CLOUD, ECO_L2G_CLOUD) to assess if a pixel is clear or cloudy (see section 3 of the User Guide). In v002 the mandatory QA flags in the QC bit mask provide the following information in bits 1 and 0:   \\\\n     * 00 - Pixel produced by TES \\\\n     * 01 - Pixel produced by TES but certain conditions are met that may degrade the LSTE accuracy (see User Guide for details) \\\\n     * 10 - Not set (previously set to cloud mask in v001)\\\\n     * 11 - Pixel not produced (see bits 3 & 2 for additional information)  \\\\n* Solar Array Obstruction: Some ECOSTRESS scenes may be affected by solar array obstructions from the International Space Station (ISS), potentially impacting data quality of obstructed pixels. The \\'FieldOfViewObstruction\\' metadata field is included in all Version 2 products to indicate possible obstructions:\\\\n     * Before October 24, 2024 (orbits prior to 35724): The field is present but was not populated and does not reliably identify affected scenes.\\\\n     * On or after October 24, 2024 (starting with orbit 35724): The field is populated and generally accurate, except for late December 2024, when a temporary processing error may have caused false positives.\\\\n     * A [list of scenes](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2249/obst_all.sort.gz) confirmed to be affected by obstructions is available and is recommended for verifying historical data (before October 24, 2024) and scenes from late December 2024.\\\\n* The ISS native pointing information is coarse relative to ECOSTRESS pixels, so ECOSTRESS geolocation is improved through image matching with a basemap. Metadata in the L1B_GEO file shows the success of this geolocation improvement, using categorizations \\\\\"best\\\\\", \\\\\"good\\\\\", \\\\\"suspect\\\\\", and \\\\\"poor\\\\\". We recommend that users use only \\\\\"best\\\\\" and \\\\\"good\\\\\" scenes for evaluations where geolocation is important (e.g., comparison to field sites). For some scenes, this metadata is not reflected in the higher-level products (e.g., land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, etc.). While this metadata is always available in the geolocation product, to save users additional download, we have produced a [summary text file](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2253/qa_20250423-present.txt) that includes the geolocation quality flags for all scenes from launch to March 2025. After this date, all higher-level products will reflect the geolocation quality flag correctly (the field name is GeolocationAccuracyQA).\",\"service_features\":{\"opendap\":{\"has_formats\":false,\"has_variables\":false,\"has_transforms\":false,\"has_combine\":false,\"has_spatial_subsetting\":false,\"has_temporal_subsetting\":false},\"esi\":{\"has_formats\":false,\"has_variables\":false,\"has_transforms\":false,\"has_combine\":false,\"has_spatial_subsetting\":false,\"has_temporal_subsetting\":false},\"harmony\":{\"has_formats\":false,\"has_variables\":false,\"has_transforms\":false,\"has_combine\":false,\"has_spatial_subsetting\":false,\"has_temporal_subsetting\":false}},\"orbit_parameters\":{},\"id\":\"C2076090826-LPCLOUD\",\"has_formats\":false,\"consortiums\":[\"GEOSS\",\"EOSDIS\"],\"original_format\":\"UMM_JSON\",\"collection_data_type\":\"SCIENCE_QUALITY\",\"archive_center\":\"LP DAAC\",\"has_temporal_subsetting\":false,\"browse_flag\":true,\"platforms\":[\"ISS\"],\"association_details\":{\"variables\":[{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263018-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263052-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263087-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263133-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263178-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263195-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263215-LPCLOUD\"},{\"concept_id\":\"V3208263230-LPCLOUD\"}],\"tools\":[{\"concept_id\":\"TL1860232272-LPDAAC_ECS\"}]},\"online_access_flag\":true,\"links\":[{\"length\":\"7.3MB\",\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=C2076090826-LPCLOUD\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L2T_LSTE.002\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/lp-daac\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2235/ECO2_LSTE_ATBD_V1.1.pdf\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/browse#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/lp-prod-public/ECO_L2T_LSTE.002/ECOv002_L2T_LSTE_21247_032_19MCN_20220405T135253_0700_01/ECOv002_L2T_LSTE_21247_032_19MCN_20220405T135253_0700_01.png\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/380/ECO2_PSD_V1.pdf\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/299/ECO2_ASD_V1.pdf\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1655/ECO_L1C-4_Grid_Tile_User_Guide_V2.pdf\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1574/ECOL2_User_Guide_V2.pdf\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://github.com/nasa/ECOSTRESS-Data-Resources\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2249/obst_all.sort.gz\"},{\"rel\":\"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#\",\"hreflang\":\"en-US\",\"href\":\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2253/qa_20250423-present.txt\"}]}]}}'"
